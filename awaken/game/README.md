# Awaken API Tester

Disposable browser UI for exercising the Awaken simulation without curl.

Start the full stack from `awaken/`:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. The page talks to the FastAPI service at
`http://localhost:8000` and can seed the YAML world, select one of each NPC's
six authored tracks, emit quest and faction events, inspect automatically synced
belief state, and inspect HydraDB memories.

To remove the tester later, delete `game/`, remove the `game` service from
`docker-compose.yml`, and remove the temporary `GET .../memories` route from
`api/app/routers/npcs.py`.
