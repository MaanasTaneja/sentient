# Awaken

Emergent faction/NPC simulation with YAML-authored worlds, PostgreSQL runtime
state, HydraDB world knowledge and NPC memories, and LLM-generated beliefs and
dialogue constrained by five authored interaction tracks.

## Run locally

The schema changed during the YAML/track migration, so reset the development
database once:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build -d
```

Required `.env` values:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
HYDRA_DB_API_KEY=...
HYDRA_TENANT_ID=awaken
```

The HydraDB tenant must already exist and report `ready_for_ingestion=true`.

Press **Seed / Reset YAML World** in the tester. Seeding validates
[`worlds/aelryn.yaml`](worlds/aelryn.yaml), resets that world's SQL runtime
state, and upserts canonical lore, factions, entities, quests, and NPC
biographies into HydraDB Knowledge.

## Authored world contract

The YAML definition contains:

- world description, lore, locations, and entities;
- faction lore, beliefs, fears, prejudices, and interpretation prompts;
- quests, essential flags, objectives, completion event/filter rules, and
  protected offered/refused/active/completed base statements;
- NPC faction/quest assignments, personality dimensions, behavior prompts,
  relationships, and exactly five tracks;
- event interpretation guidance.

Every NPC exposes `greeting`, `identity`, `quest_offer`, `quest_status`,
`opinion`, and `world_lore`.
The browser sends a track ID, never arbitrary dialogue text.

## Runtime flow

1. Selecting a track appends a normal targeted `PLAYER_ASKED_TRACK` event.
2. The NPC processes new faction events and hearsay from explicitly configured
   directed relationships. There is no fixed trust threshold; the model sees
   relationship type, trust, and affinity and interprets the hearsay.
3. Objective event memories are persisted to HydraDB independently of the LLM.
4. A strict structured-output belief call updates subjective state and may add
   interpreted memories.
5. HydraDB retrieves shared world Knowledge and that NPC's private Memory.
6. `quest_offer` protects only the offer/refuse branch: essential quests always
   offer, while optional quests receive an emergent model decision.
7. `quest_status` is fully generated from actual lifecycle state, completion
   events, beliefs, and retrieved context.
8. A strict dialogue call personalizes the selected track. Protected quest
   facts and the selected branch cannot be reversed.

## Main endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /seed` | Load YAML and upsert HydraDB world knowledge |
| `GET /worlds/{world}/npcs/{npc}/tracks` | Return the five authored tracks |
| `POST /worlds/{world}/npcs/{npc}/interact` | Run one track |
| `POST /worlds/{world}/events` | Append a world/faction event and apply quest completion rules |
| `POST /worlds/{world}/npcs/{npc}/sync` | Process unseen events for one NPC |
| `POST /worlds/{world}/tick` | Process unseen events for every NPC |
| `GET /worlds/{world}/npcs/{npc}/player-state` | Inspect subjective player beliefs |
| `GET /worlds/{world}/npcs/{npc}/memories` | Inspect retrieved NPC memories |

## Tests

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps api python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests cover YAML completeness, strict structured belief output, HydraDB memory
scope, and world-knowledge upsert payloads.
